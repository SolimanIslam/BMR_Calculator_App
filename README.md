Welcome to the Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) Calculator, a simple and straightforward tool designed to estimate your daily calorie expenditure at rest. BMR is the amount of energy your body uses to maintain essential functions while you are at rest, such as breathing, circulation, and cell repair. Understanding your BMR is crucial for setting realistic weight loss or weight management goals, as it provides a baseline for determining your total daily calorie needs.

Our BMR calculator utilizes the widely accepted Harris-Benedict formula, a scientifically validated method that considers factors such as age, sex, weight, and height to calculate an individual's BMR. Simply input your personal information into the calculator, and it will provide you with an estimated value of your daily calorie expenditure at rest.

Whether you're seeking to lose weight, gain muscle, or simply maintain a healthy lifestyle, understanding your BMR is an essential step in making informed dietary decisions. With our user-friendly BMR calculator, you can gain valuable insights into your body's energy needs and make informed choices to achieve your health and fitness goals.
